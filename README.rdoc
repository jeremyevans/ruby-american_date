= ruby-american_date

ruby-american_date exists to make ruby 1.9+ parse american-style
month/day/year dates correctly, with behavior matching ruby 1.8.7.
It can also be used on earlier ruby version, but it is basically
a noop there.

As far as I know, there isn't a gem that already handles this. You
can find many snippets on the web that partially solve the issue, but
most won't be compatible with ruby 1.9.3, because Date.parse and
DateTime.parse no longer call Date._parse directly on 1.9.3. Also
most don't handle cases where an american date format is used in
addition to a time format.

Note that this gem only handles / separated dates.  It does not
handle - or . separated dates.  This is by design, for compatibility
with ruby 1.8.7.

== Design

The general idea is fairly simple.  We look for a month/day/year
substring in the input string, and if we find it, we transform it
into a year-month-day ISO format string before passing it to the
standard date parsing methods.  This is probably the least invasive
way that works correctly on both the pure-ruby date parser (<1.9.3)
and the C extension date parser (>=1.9.3).

== Tested ruby versions

* ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, 2.0.0, 2.1.0
* rubinius 1.2.4, 2.2.6
* jruby 1.6.5, 1.7.9 (both --1.8 and --1.9 modes)

== Installation

ruby-american_date is distributed as a gem, and can be installed with:

  gem install american_date
  
For Rails users, you can also just add to your gemfile:

  gem 'american_date'
 
Then run <code>bundle</code> from the command line.
  
== Usage for Rails users

ruby-american_date works "behind the scenes" to find month/day/year 
substrings in places like form fields. Once the gem
is installed, you'll be good to go. No more formatting with JavaScript,
messing with hidden fields or using private methods to adjust your values.
